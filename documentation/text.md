# I want to make this weather app as complete and as accessible as possible.

## Documentation standards

Each program or function should have the following information:

### Goals

- What is the goal of the program or function?

### Input

- What (if any) input does the program or function accept?
  Are there any specific data types or ranges?

### Output

- What (if any) output does the program or function return

### Steps
- What are the steps (written in English) necessary to solve
  this problem. This should NOT be programming code, but each line
  should be specific enough to be translated to a line or two of code
  in your target language.

App goal: deliver weather information about current city + 5 additional cities if the user desire so.

Starting with the main page on mobile:
  - First container: Display the current city, current temperature, time, weather condition, max & min temperatures

  - Second container: Display forecast information about the city, 24hours and 3 days, scrollable.

  - Third container: UV Index & Wind gust + Details button which gives access to the details (Everything accessible on desktop).

  - Fourth container: Navigation dots, navigate between cities + button (+) that leads to city search.
